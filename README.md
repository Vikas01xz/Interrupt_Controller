# Interrupt_Controller
Author: Vikas Kumar <vikasrajput1306@gmail.com>

This is a 8-input interrupt controller which works in two modes.
Mode 1: Polling
Mode 2: Priority 

Polling: In polling, all the interrupts are checked periodically by interrupt controller
and serviced if found active.
Priority: In priority mode, the interrupts are assigned in a priority order by the uP and 
according to the priority, interrupts are serviced.
